== Description ==

Plug and play lead capture form for WordPress. Fully configurable. Allows you to find an agent to call the prospect right away, or have them schedule a meeting, or tell them "we'll get back to you". Leads can flow to your CRM via Zapier or directly to Salesforce. Part of CrankWheel, which you can use to seamlessly screen share with prospects coming in through this channel.

CrankWheel provides **specialized screen sharing** for inside sales teams, a 3rd tool that complements telephone and email. With integrated <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">lead capture</a>, <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">lead enrichment</a> and <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">agent allocation</a>, CrankWheel ushers interested prospects from a companyâ€™s website to a phone call and <a href="http://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/">screen share</a> with one of its salespeople.

== How it works? ==

The Wordpress plugin lets you change any button on your website into an **Instant Demo** or **Call me Now** call-to-action button. It allows visitors to request a phone call and optionally a screen sharing session and will notify you and any other agents at your company about it in real time.

Presentations and broadcasting are done through **Screen Sharing**. CrankWheel can display the content of your programs, browser tabs and even clone the entire screen, enabling others to see what you see.

Stop doing what everybody else is failing at - scheduling meetings and delaying the customer from purchasing your products. By helping out in under a minute you're <a href="http://crankwheel.com/how-to-massively-increase-the-chance-of-qualifying-sales-leads/">21 times more likely to sell your product!</a>

== Use Cases ==

= Lead Capture =

Instant Demo buttons on your website open up popup forms that capture telephone and e-mail information from requesters. You receive a notification immediately after a user submits that data. That's the moment when you can call your customer, start screen sharing and even broadcast your screen on their mobile device.

= Closing Sales Online =

Some purchases can only be completed through signatures - in person. Instead of having a website that just points people to your physical location, you can now share your screen with customers, show the documents online and use an e-signature service to close more sales. Imagine how much time can be saved thanks to this!

= Customer Success Management =

Embedding request a demo buttons throughout the website visitor's journey builds their confidence that at any point they can request high-touch help from a real person. The ability to request that you show your customer exactly what they need to see in order to succeed has never yet been available on WordPress!
